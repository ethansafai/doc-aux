# DocAux Frontend Development Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the frontend development approach for the DocAux application, focusing on creating a user-friendly and efficient interface to enhance diagnostic outcomes in the medical field. The frontend is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Objectives

- To develop a responsive and intuitive user interface that simplifies the diagnostic process for medical professionals.
- To ensure seamless navigation and interaction within the DocAux application, enhancing user experience.
- To implement a design that is compliant with medical industry standards, focusing on accessibility and ease of use.

## Key Features

### 1. Account Management

- **Creating A New DocAux Profile:** A simple form will allow new doctors and patients to create their DocAux profile by entering necessary personal and professional information.

### 2. Dashboard Navigation

- **DocAux Dashboard:** The main dashboard serves as the operational hub, providing quick access to various functionalities like patient file management, image capture, and report generation.

### 3. Image Capture and Analysis

- **Capturing Images:** Users can upload or capture live images through the application. The interface will include easy-to-use controls for capturing and submitting images for analysis.

### 4. Reporting and Communication

- **Reports and Messaging:** A secure and intuitive interface for generating, viewing, and sharing diagnostic reports. It will also facilitate secure messaging within the DocAux network between doctors and patients.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
